This is a non exaustive and not well ordered list of things I would like to add or look into

* more complex animation curves, e.g. with some more bouncing (using multiple parameters ?)
  see https://css-tricks.com/build-complex-css-transitions-using-custom-properties-and-cubic-bezier/
* configuration for other languages
* no fixed number of fields but dynamic expansion or detection
* make it work with proper HTML DocType instead of quirks mode
* make it work on Samsung TV / Tizen browser
* change picture
* change box with parameters interval, offset, amount and possibility to set value to be used in css or directly changing style background-image
