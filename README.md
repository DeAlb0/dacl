# dacl D.A. clock

This repo is **under construction**
It will undergo **heavy changes**. So be warned in case you want to use it or rely on things here,

This repo contains a clock that can show the time and different formats, especially in words with animated transitions
when these word change.

It is implemented in javascript and uses html and css. So all you have to do to see it is to open the .html file.

At current stage it uses german words only, but is made with the idea that it can be extend for other languages, but details how this can be ported need to be worked out.

This is currently licensed under the quite restrictive GPLv3. If you want to use it somewhere where GPLv3 would be a problem, talk to me.
