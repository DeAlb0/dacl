# dacl D.A. clock

This repo is **under construction**
It will undergo **heavy changes**. So be warned in case you want to use it or rely on things here,

This repo contains a clock that can show the time and different formats, especially in words with animated transitions
when these word change.

See the example here : https://dealb0.github.io/textuhr/myclock.html

It is implemented in javascript and uses html and css. So all you have to do to see it is to open the .html file.

At current stage it uses german words only, but is made with the idea that it can be extend for other languages, but details how this can be ported need to be worked out.

This is currently not licensed, as it is under work. Means I own the rights and do not yet grant other rights than those I am obliged to. I plan to open it.
If you are interested let me know.
